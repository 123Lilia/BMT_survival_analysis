# Analysis of Bone Marrow Transplant Data

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze data related to bone marrow transplants (BMT) to identify key factors influencing patient outcomes and to develop predictive models for survival rates post-transplant.

## Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing clinical data from bone marrow transplant patients. The analysis includes exploring various factors such as patient demographics, clinical conditions, and treatment details to determine their impact on transplant success. Predictive models are built to estimate patient survival rates based on these factors.

## Key Features:

Data exploration and preprocessing of clinical BMT data.
Identification of key predictors for transplant success.
Implementation of survival analysis techniques.
Development of predictive models using machine learning.
Evaluation and comparison of model performance.

## Tools & Libraries:

Python,
Scikit-learn,
Pandas,
Lifelines (for survival analysis),
Matplotlib

## Usage:
This project is beneficial for healthcare professionals, researchers, and data scientists interested in the field of medical data analysis and predictive modeling in healthcare.
